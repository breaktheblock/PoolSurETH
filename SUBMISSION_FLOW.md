# Submission Flow & Demo

We will follow similar rules done by [status.im global hackathon](https://github.com/status-im/hackathon).

You can watch [this YouTube video for the walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCJs4zFIjzg)

## Step 1: Team registration (by Saturday noon).

Once you decide the team, please submit an issue describing the followings

- Team name:
- Team members (assign yourself to the issue):
- Team leader:
- What problem are you trying to solve?:
- Why do you think Blockchain/SmartContract may be the right approach?:
- API/DATA/Gadget you are thinking about using:

It is understandable that the idea will change througout the hackathon. This is more for us to understand what area you are working on and if mentors can help progressing your ideas.

## Step3: Final submission (by 2pm)

When the deadline reaches, we will clone your repo into our org.
Please follow [the example README] file

## Step4: Tech cross review (by Sunday 2pm ~ 3pm)

While your team is finalising your pitch slide, I encourage some of your technical members to look into other team's code. If you noticed that any given project has no code or some suspicious code (eg: copy&past from somewhere), please comment on the PR, so that judges ,mentors, and organising members will take further look prior to the demo.

- Main sponsors will have a short presentation (max 2min)
- Each team have 5 min to pitch with following 2 min of Q&A from judges.

## Setp6: Judging
