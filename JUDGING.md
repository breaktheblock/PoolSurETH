## General guidelines

The theme of this hackathon is the application of blockchain technologies in the insurance industry.

All entires must make use of blockchain technologies. Entries must attempt to solve a problem facing the insurance industry or should relate to opportunities in the more general area of protecting people/businesses/governments from unexpected financial loss.

Entires could relate to any part of the insurance eco-system, for example:
- Underwriting: taking on risk in return for money (a premium) and the process of calculating premiums and the terms of the insurance contract.
- Insurance distribution: the interaction between buyers and sellers of insurance.
- Customer service: the experience of buying and benefiting from insurance protection.
- Claims handling & loss adjusting: the process of validating insurance claims and helping policyholders get back to the same position they were in before a loss.
- Fraud prevention: stopping false claims which amount to Â£1.3bn a year in the UK alone.
- Risk management: ways to reduce the likelihood of an insurable loss happening in the first place.
- Alternative Risk Transfer: other techniques to provide entities that face financial risk with coverage and protection.

### Notes
- Code does not have to be a SmartContract.
- If you are building on top of existing service/smart contract, please make it clear  which part is built by your team during hackathon.


## Examples

### Good

- I am building xx insurance as a smart contract.
- I am building a new insurance product which will benefit xxx blockchain/smart contract service (as long as there are any code to back up your hypothesis)

### Bad

- The project has nothing to do with Insurance.
- The project has no code at all (mock-up UI is not counted as code).
- The project does not articulate why it uses blockchain.

### Border lines

- I already have insurance smart contract I build and want to build mobile interface through status.im (okay if it's a bot?)
- I am building a gambling dapp. Isn't Insurance same as gambling (ie: xxx delay dapp)?
- I built a new gadget/wallet which benefits more with insurance smart contract.
- I am going to use R3 Corda
