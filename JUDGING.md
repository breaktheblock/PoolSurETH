# Judging

## Judges

WIP

## General guideline

- Code does not have to be SmartContract.
- If you are building on top of existing service/smart contract, please make it clear  which part is built by your team during hackathon.

##Â Examples

### Good

- I am building xx insurance as a smart contract.
- I am building a new insurance product which will benefit xxx blockchain/smart contract service (as long as there are any code to back up your hypothesis)

### Bad

- The project has nothing to do with Insurance.
- The project has no code at all (mockup UI is not counted as code).
- The project does not articulate why it uses blockchain.

### Border lines

- I already have insurance smart contract I build and want to build mobile interface through status.im (okay if it's a bot?)
- I am building a gambling dapp. Isnt' Insurance same as gambling (ie: xxx delay dapp)?
- I built a new gadget/wallet which benefits more with insurance smart contract.
- I am going to use R3 Corda
